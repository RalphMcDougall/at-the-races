## Introduction
![Start view](readme_images/Start.png?raw=true "Start view")
A random horse racing game I made one evening because I had nothing better to do... The user chooses which horse they want to win.
A race is then simulated with the user getting an extremely satisfying display if their horse wins the race. For the best
experience, your sound should be on. To reset the game, press the "R" key.

## Easter egg
Types "MLG" before a race starts to toggle the easter-egg mode.
