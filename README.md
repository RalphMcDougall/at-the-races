## Introduction
![Start view](readme_images/Start.png?raw=true "Start view")
A random horse racing game I made one evening because I had nothing better to do... The user chooses which horse they want to win.
A race is then simulated with the user getting an extremely satisfying display if their horse wins the race. For the best
experience, your sound should be on. To reset the game, press the "R" key.

## Getting started
This project requires Pygame to be installed. This can be done on Ubuntu with:
```
sudo apt-get install pygame
```

To run the project, open a terminal in the folder and run:
```
python3 Main.py
```

## Easter egg
Types "MLG" before a race starts to toggle the easter-egg mode. (Rather don't try it if you are epileptic)
